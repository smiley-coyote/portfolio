            <p>
                When I was a child growing up in a small town, I had a passion for creating things. 
                Whether it was palmetto forts in the backyard, a home movie about Furbies trying to take over the house, 
                or a comic book about Garfield finally leaving Jon and joining a ragtag team of misfit cats who liked 
                harassing dogs at dog parks, I felt I needed to find ways to entertain myself in my otherwise boring town. 
                Today I still have that passion. While it doesn’t involve the Furby toy by Tiger Electronics or Garfield the cat, 
                I like to create things when I can such as music, screenplays, cross-stitches, bread, movies, and much more.

                Since graduating from UCF with a film degree in 2012, I’ve had a few odd jobs. 
                Unfortunately, most of them were mind-numbing work with little to no creativity. 
                I knew I wanted a job with a mix of hands-on technical stuff and creativity, 
                so when I spoke with my friend who was in the web development field, I ran home and started teaching 
                myself HTML and CSS. Two weeks later, I finally took a break to eat and shower and now I think 
                I know what I want to do for a living.

                My name is Nick, and I currently live in the Orlando area with my girlfriend Jen and our pug Simon. I recently finished a Full Stack coding bootcamp at UCF, and I'm currently 
                looking for employement to become a full stack web developer. I am excited to continue to learn and grow in this industry.
